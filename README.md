# SlopingToolbarLayout

> A unique implementation of `CollapsingToolbarLayout` featuring a slight slope for artistic flair. As the toolbar collapses, the slope gradually decreases until it becomes straight. This design also supports a toolbar for multiple pages. The FAB (Floating Action Button) is anchored to the toolbar when expanded, and animates to the bottom corner of the page as the toolbar collapses.
